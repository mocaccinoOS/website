Installing packages coming from untrusted repositories, or building packages in the wrong way might break your system.\nThe following steps should only be carried out on test systems. Do make sure you have any important data backed up before installing any package.\n MocaccinoOS desktop, even if based on portage, doesn’t support the direct usage of emerge. Although it’s possible to compile and install packages from portage.\nTo build a system package, instead use luet build. The following document tries to summarize the steps to build a package with emerge with luet build, and install and track it in a MocaccinoOS Desktop system, should cover the scenario: “hey, can I install packages with emerge?\".\nRequirements  Be sure to have docker installed, and the daemon running. The document is assuming you are carrying the steps on MocaccinoOS Desktop (GNOME in the specific case). At least 30G of free disk space. To reclaim the space afterwards, run docker system prune --force --volumes --all  Follow the steps described in this document before going ahead.\nCreate a workspace First of all, let’s create a workspace. The packages that we will build have to persist somewhere in your local system, the location must be accessible while performing a luet upgrade. We will use /user/system_repository as an example. And we will assume the commands are running as root.\n1 2  $ mkdir -p /user/system_repository/tree $ cd /user/system_repository   All the commands from now on will be carried from the /user/system_repository directory.\nFirst package Let’s put our eyes on, let’s say, games-board/gnome-chess, and create a compilation definition for it.\nLet’s first declare it’s canonical name, or how you would actually install it afterwards with luet (e.g. luet install app/gnome-chess)\n1 2 3 4 5 6  $ mkdir tree/gnome-chess $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003etree/gnome-chess/definition.yaml category: \"apps\" name: \"gnome-chess\" version: \"0.1\" EOF   Here the version doesn’t really matter, it’s mostly for you to keep it track in your system. You can decide to follow strictly the versioning from gnome-chess, or not.\nNow let’s get to the important part, the build definition. This tells luet how to compile your package:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003etree/gnome-chess/build.yaml steps: - emerge games-board/gnome-chess requires: - category: \"layers\" name: \"gnome\" version: \"\u003e=0\" EOF   as you see, we are using emerge here to compile the package. The requires section tells from where it runs the command, which in this case is the MocaccinoOS desktop gnome layer. To see all the layers available, run luet search layers or to see the currently installed, you can run luet search --installed layers).\nNote Even if the example shows how to build a package with emerge, it is although possible to create packages out from any docker image - even not by compiling. You have to be careful to check if any package dependencies are actually already shipped by the layers  Now let’s add an installation hook to our package, in our specific case (gnome-chess) we need a trigger to generate glib schemas right after the package gets installed in the system:\n1 2 3 4  $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003etree/gnome-chess/finalize.yaml install: - glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas EOF   Building the package Now let’s build the packages (remember to run as root, or with sudo upfront):\n1  $ luet build --tree tree --pull --pull-repository quay.io/mocaccino/desktop --from-repositories --live-output --only-target-package apps/gnome-chess    Note The first time can take up some time due to downloading the images, but those are cached locally for local iteration. Time for a coffee!  After build is completed, generate the repository metadata:\n1  $ luet create-repo --tree tree   Install the package First let’s consume the repository we just created in our system:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003e /etc/luet/repos.conf.d/local.yaml name: \"local-repository\" description: \"Local repository\" type: \"disk\" enable: true cached: true priority: 99 urls: # Repository URLs - /user/system_repository/build EOF   Now we are ready to install gnome-chess locally:\n1  $ luet install apps/gnome-chess   Advanced topics Showing package files Luet shows already all the files shipped by a package with luet search. For example:\n1  $ luet search apps/gnome-chess -o yaml   Find duplicate files shipped by packages You can check duplicate files into the package shipped by repositories, also before installing them:\n1  luet search -o json | luet filter   This is particularly useful to check for any conflicting files with the system packages and the ones you are generating.\nSee also the dev section regarding duplicate files.\nRemoving generated docker images By default, images are tagged under luet/cache. So it’s possible to remove all the cache images generated by removing the luet/cache and quay.io/mocaccinocache/desktop images, although, you should also prune afterwards the images not referenced anymore by any tag with docker image prune:\n1 2 3  $ docker images --filter='reference=luet/cache' --format='{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}' | xargs -r docker rmi $ docker images --filter='reference=quay.io/mocaccino/desktop' --format='{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}' | xargs -r docker rmi $ docker image prune   A way to reclaim all the space occupied by docker more aggressively is by running docker system prune, but attention, this command will remove all the images, also the ones which weren’t generated by luet:\n1  $ docker system prune --force --volumes --all   References  Luet docs Luet Packages Luet hello world Emerge ebuild example  ","categories":"","description":"How to build packages on MocaccinoOS with portage (or not)","excerpt":"How to build packages on MocaccinoOS with portage (or not)","ref":"/docs/desktop/luet/building_packages/","tags":"","title":"Building packages locally"},{"body":"Init system The Micro and MicroServer ISO flavors are using runit as init system.

Lets start by creating a dedicated directory for this work.\nroot@mocaccino:~# mkdir -p Docker/iso-builder root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# cd Docker/iso-builder root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# touch Dockerfile root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# vim Dockerfile Now what do we need in this dockerfile?\nFROM ubuntu RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install curl xorriso squashfs-tools dosfstools RUN curl https://get.mocaccino.org/luet/get_luet_root.sh | sh RUN luet install -y extension/makeiso WORKDIR /output ENTRYPOINT [\"/usr/bin/luet-makeiso\"] So what exactly is happening here? We’re telling docker we want our image to start FROM the ubuntu core image which is very small and extremely lean. Then we’re telling docker to RUN these commands inside the docker for setup. These command update the apt repos, install a few required tools, install luet via a script, and add the makeiso luet extension. Then we’re saying we need a WORKDIR where we’re going to output our file file and we want that to be a folder we link outside the docker so we can have that ISO outside of the docker. Then we’re using ENTRYPOINT to tell docker after the image is built and started, what command do we want the docker to run?\nWant to start from Gentoo Stage3 (WIP)? Try this Dockerfile:\nFROM gentoo/stage3:systemd RUN rm -rf /var/lock RUN mkdir -p /var/lock/ RUN touch /var/lock/luet.lock RUN curl https://get.mocaccino.org/luet/get_luet_root.sh | sh RUN luet install -y extension/makeiso sys-fs/squashfs-tools sys-fs/dosfstools dev-libs/libisoburn WORKDIR /output ENTRYPOINT [\"/usr/bin/luet-makeiso\"] Building the docker image Building the docker image and installing/running the docker container are different. Building the docker image means you have the starting point image built and ready, but doesn’t mean the docker container installed and running. We’ll be building and tagging this image with a name.\n1  root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# docker build -t iso-builder .   What is this command doing? Its telling docker to build the Dockerfile inside the current directory (.) and tag (-t) it with the name iso-builder. When this is complete you should see something like this at the end:\n1 2  Successfully built af8d3b35de70 Successfully tagged iso-builder:latest   This means the docker image was successfully built and it has been tagged/named iso-builder:latest. What is with the “:latest”? Well you can have multiple revisions of docker and tag them with different version numbers. For example if I was maintaining 2 different versions such as how ubuntu LTS has multiple still supported versions we could tag it like :1804 and :2004, but for our usecases we won’t be doing that. We’ll just be using latest.\nBuilding the ISO Now we have a docker image we can use to build clean ISOs from scratch, but we’re still not done. the ENTRYPOINT command luet-makeiso requires arguements. running the command alone doesn’t just build an ISO. It needs instructions on the list of layers and packages to download and install to build a specific spin of MocaccinoOS. For the simplicity of the guide we’ll just be using Gnome, but there are multiple Mocaccino flavors for you to choose from. You can build from a pre-built specification or you can tweak a specification to make your own ISO build. Our specification files are stored at https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/mocaccino/tree/master/specs.\nLets download the gnome.yaml spec file into our iso-builder directory.\n1  root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mocaccinoOS/mocaccino/master/specs/gnome.yaml   Our iso-builder directory should now look like this:\n1 2  root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# ls Dockerfile gnome.yaml   Lets tell Docker to run our newly built docker container image and tell it to build us an ISO!\n1  root@mocaccino:~/Docker/iso-builder# docker run -ti -v $PWD:/output --privileged=true --rm iso-builder:latest gnome.yaml   So whats happening here exactly? We’re telling docker run a docker container using the iso-builder:latest image we built and we want to see the output run in a new tty/shell that is interactive (-ti) and we’re binding (-v) our current folder ($PWD) to a folder inside the docker /output. Now files in our current directly will be accessible to the docker and files the docker creates in that directory will be accessible to us. We also want the docker to delete itself when the job is complete (–rm). We also need privileges to fork the processes for speed (–privileged=true). We’re passing an argument (gnome.yaml) to the command at the ENTRYPOINT command of the docker. So Effectively the docker is running the command /usr/bin/luet-makeiso gnome.yaml and that gnome.yaml file is accessible because its in the WORKDIR /output that we binded to the docker.\nNow the docker will begin as a minimal image installing all required files via luet to have a bootable mocaccino gnome system. This will take some time. After all the packages are installed into the docker it will begin building an ISO of the current snapshot of that docker. After the ISO build is complete, the ISO will be dumped into /output which also happens to be the current directory your in on the host system ~/Docker/iso-builder#. After that is complete, the docker will proceed to remove itself. This cleans up any unncessary dockers and bloat on your system, but leaves you with the ISO in your iso-builder directory.\n","categories":"","description":"Building ISOs for testing or custom ISOs.","excerpt":"Building ISOs for testing or custom ISOs.","ref":"/docs/general/iso-building/","tags":"","title":"ISO building"},{"body":"Mocaccino Desktop is a Gentoo-based distribution (derived from Sabayon) oriented towards Desktop systems.\nIt contains installable “apps” that we refer internally as “layers” to install common suite of packages needed to bootstrap a pure and simple OS.\nA user should be able then to install KDE Plasma by running luet install layers/plasma and nothing else. That package should install all the necessary components to make the “app” work as expected. The user shouldn’t be exposed to the typical OS architecture of bringing with it dozens of dependencies. Simply said: All micropackages are abstracted away and are included in a layer and installed as a single package.\nThink at it like Android apps: Install and uninstall should be as simple as that.\nThis approach is completely different from Mocaccino Micro, which is a LFS and all packages are compiled 1:1.\nIn this repository, updates are OTA-alike, with less friction as possible.\nWhy MOS Desktop is different? For the user, MOS Desktop is a pure and simple OS. We target to deliver an unique approach on package installation and upgrades. Applications should bundle all the required dependencies in order to run, or alternatively share common layers that are used between them (for example think about MATE, GNOME, and all software that depends on GTK). This allows users to have OTA-alike updates, without having to struggle with all packages dependencies.\nFrom a developer standpoint, MOS takes a unique approach on package building, allowing developers to iterate locally changes to the packages very easily, thanks to the Luet flexible backend approach. You can use Docker to build packages locally, or Kubernetes to build them in your cluster\n","categories":"","description":"MocaccinoOS variant based from Portage","excerpt":"MocaccinoOS variant based from Portage","ref":"/docs/desktop/","tags":"","title":"Mocaccino Desktop"},{"body":"Network Manager By default your system is configured with dhcp using Netwok Manager.

Have a look at the official Luet docs about package building, and feel free to submit your first PR! Be sure to also read all this document to get an Idea on how things should look like.\nHow do I know which version of a package is available in the Portage tree We pin Portage versions by using packages that are shipping a version of it. This guarantees that there are no moving parts, and we can in this way provide updates as part of a development lifecycle.\nWe have an automated bot that automatically opens PR to track new version of the available Portage version. The package is available here: https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/tree/master/packages/portage. You don’t need to do it manually. Just wait for a PR from MarvinHatesOceans to pop-up, we will review it and merge it only when we decide (after proper QA) that a development lifecycle is over.\nA Portage bump happens when:\n We close a dev cycle (release, and upgrades) Security fixes  So, how do I know which package I can build? At the moment is as easy as browsing the portage git and point it at the same commit of our package.\nFor example:\ngit.hash: \"b0e157b071cb23b348acab3d596b49f66c244808\" in https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/blob/e9ae4aafead5a79d1d36630c932d907361d8c93c/packages/portage/definition.yaml#L6 tells you that we are pinning at commit b0e157b071cb23b348acab3d596b49f66c244808 of portage tree. So you can e.g. point your browser at : https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/tree/b0e157b071cb23b348acab3d596b49f66c244808\nHow do I revbump a package? (and when it’s actually needed?) By convention, we have chosen to increment the version of a package after the +, following semver notation.\nThat means, if a package version is at 1.0.0, it’s revbump version would be 1.0.0+1, and a subsequent one would be for example 1.0.0+2.\nWhen I do need to bump a package? Only when there is a new version available!\nWhen I do need to revbump a package? A Package revbump is necessary when you apply changes to build.yaml, although, it’s not always necessary, but just in few cases:\n When you change steps in the build.yaml When you change prelude in the build.yaml When you change requires in the build.yaml  What about packages depending on it? Always by convention, we have chosen to revbump manually those. Luet does support tracking automatically new package versions, but we want to make this transparent in the Git repository, so reverting changes introduced by mistakes it’s easier, and so we also rely on the caching mechanism of Luet.\nIf we don’t revbump reverse dependencies our CI would skip such changes, because we enforced this by policy.\nHow do I do that? Until https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/issues/7 is delivered, it is a manual process.\nHow do I add a useflag to a Portage package or layer? If the useflag you are going to add doesn’t have an huge impact on its dependencies (not requiring a rebuild) then it’s fine to apply at the spec-level. Otherwise it might be required to specify the useflags needed in that specific package, or on the parent layer which your package is depending on, requiring a package revbump.\nTake the layers/system-x package as an example, in the prelude steps of the package, we copy over the building container the custom useflags in the prelude steps:\n1 2 3 4 5  prelude:- cp -rf package.use /etc/portage/- cp -rf make.conf /etc/portage/- cp -rf package.accept_keywords /etc/portage/- cp -rf package.license /etc/portage/  the package.use folder is actually shipped with the package spec. That approach can be used also in layers depending on system-x, with a separate set of flags. You just have to be sure to not override any useflag between layers, and to try to share as much as you can with parent layers while do you see it fit.\nHow do I split a package? A layer can be split into multiple packages, using the excludes/includes pattern which is used for example by gcc and gcc-base. This means you can safely compile packages into parent-layers, and exclude those in the final artifact which gets installed by the end-user.\nFor example, for gcc we drop the files from system-x, and we include explicitly files to the gcc package, which at that point doesn’t need to compile anything by itself. It just needs to depend on the parent layer, so all the gcc files are accessible from that container.\nIn the system-x spec, you will find something similar:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  excludes:...# GCC split- ^/etc/env.d/04gcc-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu- ^/etc/ld.so.conf.d/05gcc-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.conf- ^/etc/env.d/gcc.*- ^/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/gcc.*- ^/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.*- ^/usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.*- ^/usr/bin/c\\+\\+.*- ^/usr/bin/cc$- ^/usr/bin/cpp.*  This tells luet to exclude those files from the final artifact.\nSimilarly, you can find in the gcc package those files being included:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  includes:...- /usr/lib/gcc$- /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu$- /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/lib/go$- /usr/lib/go/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/lib64$- /usr/lib64/go$- /usr/lib64/go/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/libexec$- /usr/libexec/gcc$- /usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu$- /usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/share$- /usr/share/gcc-data$- /usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu$- /usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/{{.Values.version}}.*  How do I try my changes? You need at least Docker running locally, or img installed.\nTo build a package, just edit/add the relevant specs and run PACKAGES=\"..\" make rebuild-all.\nHow can I debug the build environment? Luet generates docker images for each package, you can start a shell by either retrieving the docker image of the package manually with luet tree images and manually run docker run.. on it. Here an example how we shell into layers/X:\n1  luet tree images --image-repository quay.io/mocaccino/desktop layers/X   This returns a list of docker containers where layers/X image is created from.\n1 2 3 4 5  layers/gentoo-portage-0.20230110: quay.io/mocaccino/desktop:febbfe7192e42abb3671acd65ff3ec7a6cfad063334f5c24301f30b56f0ad7dd layers/system-x-0.20230110: quay.io/mocaccino/desktop:7343fcc6f4bbbf5906b3104ad96431192a0110fb020186825409abac6587ddc3 layers/codecs-7+22: quay.io/mocaccino/desktop:4e885e2b509102e808f21efa38f4734c98e23279775beb2b3a0ec6db182f7ebd layers/sys-fs-0.9+27: quay.io/mocaccino/desktop:e1ae4a4e732e8a866721d380c7a30c930996d6d0e1840deaa5901d35f72a3b35 layers/X-1.1+28: quay.io/mocaccino/desktop:865b8d9662679f9c145f13b82c803f3380d7b5dbfad2fa2316646a46977ad3c2   Now that we know the image string we can apply that to our docker command:\n1  docker run -ti --rm quay.io/mocaccino/desktop:865b8d9662679f9c145f13b82c803f3380d7b5dbfad2fa2316646a46977ad3c2 /bin/bash   Or you can use the luet extension which does that already for you. You need to have installed system/luet-devkit package, and you can use it as follows:\n1  DOCKER_HOST=\"...\" LUET_ARGS=\"--image-repository quay.io/mocaccino/desktop\" luet remote-exec packagename   Note: It’s not required DOCKER_HOST unless you want to leverage a remote host.\nOnce you are hooked into the container there are some limited tools at your disposal that might help you. For instance if you want to list all the atoms that are installed you can do:\n1  qlist -IRv   How do I add a package? Have a look at the official docs about specfile and their syntax. After you familiarize with it, you can just open up a PR, by taking as an example an already existing layer. See, for example calamares\nHow do I update provides list, and what are they? Provides are packages that your layer/package is going to satisfy. That means if other packages are depending on a package/foo, and that is provided by package/bar, package/bar will get installed in place of package/foo.\nAt the moment it’s a manual process - and we will work an automated way as soon as we have bandwidth for it. This mechanism it’s used to ensure a smooth migration path from Sabayon/Entropy based systems.\nHow do I know that a package belongs to a Layer? Packages belonging to a layer should be listed as provides, and also part of the arguments to emerge for compiling that package. Until we deliver https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/issues/6 - it is also a manual process. Refer to the section of this document “How can I debug the build environment?” to see how to hook directly into a package container to inspect its content.\nHow do I find the duplicate files in the package repositories? You can use luet search and luet filter to compose a list of duplicate files. luet 0.11.3 returns the files in the packages as part of the json result:\n1  luet search -o json | luet filter   To install luet-filter, just run:\n1  luet install -y extension/filter   Note: luet search searches into online repositories enabled in the system unless --installed is specified. You need to have the desktop repo enabled locally in order to retrieve this list.\nFilter by package fields As luet filter can be piped, you can use jq to narrow down the search by specific by package fields. For example, to filter out by category, you can:\n1 2 3  $ luet search -o json | jq '{ packages: [.packages[] | select( .category == \"kernel-modules\" )] }' | luet filter Duplicate found for etc/modprobe.d/vboxdrv.conf in kernel-modules/virtualbox-modules kernel-modules/virtualbox-modules-lts Duplicate found for usr/lib/modules-load.d/virtualbox.conf in kernel-modules/virtualbox-modules kernel-modules/virtualbox-modules-lts   Note, the query is select( .category == \"kernel-modules\" ) and you can customize it further to narrow down to specific queries.\nExamples Filtering kernel luet search -o json | jq '{ packages: [.packages[] | select( .category != \"kernel\" )] }' | luet filter \u003e\u003e dups.txt\nFiltering ‘layers’ and ‘repository category luet search -o json | jq '{ packages: [.packages[] | select( .category != \"repository\" ) | select(.category != \"layers\") ] }' | luet filter \u003e\u003e dups.txt\nThe package I want to add needs a user/group. Where do I add it? The user/groups in MocaccinoOS are defined by entities. They are an uniform way to define user/groups across different distributions in a unique and interoperable way. The same users/groups are indeed shared with Mocaccino Micro.\nAll the users groups are defined in a unique collection inside the os-commons repository, here\nHow do I add a system-wide extension, or configure a gnome setting? We have a gnome-skel package for that purpose.

Since it is installed as a dependency of lxc, you might as well enable it.\nEnable the apparmor service:\n1  systemctl enable --now apparmor.service   Enable required boot parameters. Edit /etc/default/grub with your preferred text editor (e.g., sudo nano /etc/default/grub) and find GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and append apparmor=1 security=apparmor parameters.\n1  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"apparmor=1 security=apparmor\"   After editing this file, regenerate the grub config file:\n1  $ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg   Now restart the system.\nReferences  Gentoo Wiki Waydroid homepage  ","categories":"","description":"Installing and configuring waydroid in Mocaccino Desktop","excerpt":"Installing and configuring waydroid in Mocaccino Desktop","ref":"/docs/desktop/software/waydroid/","tags":"","title":"Waydroid"},{"body":"Create the webserver documentroot in your homedir 1  $ mkdir website   Install Apache container Now we pull the httpd:2.4 container from dockerhub and map the documentroot to our just created directory\n1  $ sudo docker run -dit --name my-web -p 8080:80 -v ~/website/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4   We use docker ps to confirm our container is running\n1 2 3  $ sudo docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES e837d58776cd httpd:2.4 \"httpd-foreground\" 18 seconds ago Up 16 seconds 0.0.0.0:8080-\u003e80/tcp my-web   Create a simple homepage Add index.html to our documentroot\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003e/website/index.html \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eMy website rocks!\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to my homepage!\u003c/h1\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e EOF   And we are done!

Highlights include:\n  Performance enhancements: Across releases, binaries have been rebuilt with more aggressive compiler flags for better speed and leaner size.   Improved hardware and compatibility support:  Intel Xe and ARC Battlemage detection code integrated. Additional udev rules for older HDD detection.    Flatpak sandboxing fixes (notably for apps like Nextcloud).   Installer updates: Calamares now correctly applies user-selected system languages during installation.
