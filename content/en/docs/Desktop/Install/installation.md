Installing MocaccinoOS Using the Calamares Installer

This guide walks you through installing MocaccinoOS to your hard drive using the Calamares graphical installer. It applies to all editions of MocaccinoOS, including KDE Plasma, GNOME, XFCE, and MATE.

## Boot into the Live Environment

After downloading the MocaccinoOS ISO and writing it to a USB stick, boot your computer from the USB. You’ll be greeted with the live session desktop.

## Partition Your Disk

    Replace a partition – Overwrites an existing partition.

    Manual partitioning – Advanced option for custom layouts.

Make sure to back up important data before continuing.
