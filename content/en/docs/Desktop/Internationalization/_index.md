MocaccinoOS provides optional internationalization features through modular layers.
This includes input methods, language data, and fonts for non-Latin scripts.

These components are not installed by default to keep the base system minimal,
but can be added at any time.

## Available features

- Input methods (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.) → see [Fcitx](fcitx/) or [IBus](ibus/)
- Fonts for additional scripts (CJK, emoji, etc.)
- Locale and language data

All internationalization layers follow the MocaccinoOS design principle of
including **runtime components only**, keeping the system lightweight.
