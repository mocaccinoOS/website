### Steam

We recommend installing Steam directly from the desktop repository. You can also use the flathub version but that could give problems because it is basically running in a sandbox.
To install Steam from the desktop repository you can issue the following installation command:

```bash
$ sudo luet install apps/steam
```
## Gamemode

### Heroic Games Launcher

### Nvidia
