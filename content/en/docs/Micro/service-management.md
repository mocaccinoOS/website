     Service management on Mocaccino Micro

## Init system

The `Micro` and `MicroServer` ISO flavors are using `runit` as `init` system. For ease of use, a __very simple__ helper is provided, and can be used as follows:

### List available services

```bash
$ runit-list
```

### Start a service

```bash
$ runit-start sshd
```

### Stop a service

```bash
$ runit-stop sshd
```

### Enable a service on boot

```bash
$ runit-enable sshd
```

### Disable a service from booting on startup

```bash
$ runit-disable sshd
```

### Boot scripts

It's possible to add scripts to be executed during boot execution, under `/etc/runit/core-services/*.sh`.

For example:

```bash
$ echo "modprobe e1000e" > /etc/runit/core-services/modules.sh
```

## Yip Integration

Mocaccino Micro can be configured to execute `yipfiles` during different stages. 

```bash
$ luet install runit-srv/yip
```

To start the `yip` service:

```bash
$ runit-start yip
```

To Enable yip on boot:
```bash
$ runit-enable yip
```

### Yip files running periodically

The yip service runs periodically yip files in `/etc/yip.d`, `/etc/yip.yaml` and from the boot cmdline on the system. 

For example, by creating a yip file as `/etc/yip.d/sshd.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "sshd"
stages:
  reconcile:
  -  name: "sshd_config setup"
     commands: 
     - chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     files:
     - path: "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
       owner: 0
       group: 0
       permission: 644
       content: |
                 AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
                 PermitRootLogin yes
                 ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
```

`yip` will make sure and keep sshd configured.


There are two stages currently supported: `reconcile` and `boot`. The `boot` `yip` stage is run at start, during runit initialization, while the `reconcile` is called periodically. You can also run `yip-reconcile` to trigger the execution manually.

For more information about yip, [check here](https://github.com/mudler/yip). To see a sample `/etc/yip.d` control-repo [check here](https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/yipcontrol-sample).

### Specifying yip files from boot

It is also possible to use `yip` to automatically configure the system from boot.

Add `yip=...` to the boot command lines to specify the `yip` file to execute across the stages (can be a path to a local file, or either a URL)
