Welcome to the MocaccinoOS wiki!

MocaccinoOS is a minimal meta-Linux distribution. It uses [Luet](https://luet-lab.github.io/docs) as a package manager, which is static and uses containers to build packages.

Main features of MocaccinoOS:

- Focused on minimalism, small footprint, and ease of use
- Native vanilla upstream kernel: We closely follow kernel versions from upstream, LTS included.
- Unique approach to package management: SAT-solving is also applied on packages built in containers (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Meta distribution: It can be easily used to bootstrap other OS or spin-offs
- Local iteration: With the container ecosystem, it's easy to iterate development locally
- Cloud first: Support for the most important cloud technology in the landscape
- Different variants: From server to desktop, from systemd to runit!

Here you will find installations, articles, and how-tos for the MocaccinoOS variants.
