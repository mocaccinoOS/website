     MocaccinoOS v1.1 release
---

Hello everybody!

Today we are releasing MocaccinoOS v1.1
This is mostly an upgraded version that doesn't introduce too many new features. Everything is compiled against a very recent (7 days old) Gentoo Portage tree.  With this release we also introduce the XFCE edition. A nice addition to the MOS family.

The team hopes you enjoy our effort.
With kind regards,

Ettore Di Giacinto
