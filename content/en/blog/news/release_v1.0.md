     MocaccinoOS v1.0 release
---

Hello everybody!

We have decided to finally release MocaccinoOS 1.0 "Lisa".
Many thanks for the feedback we got during the beta stage. Also many thanks to our patrons who supported the project financially.

Although we are releasing version 1.0 this doesn't mean everything is perfect yet.
Many things still need to be improved, for instance artwork, themes and documentation.
Hopefully we can work together with the community to achieve this in a matter of months.

Special thanks to our upstream Gentoo Linux for providing us the tools and packages that are of the highest quality.
To our former developer Daniele Rondina we want to say: Good luck building a distrubution based on Funtoo Linux.


The team hopes you enjoy our effort.
With kind regards,

Ettore Di Giacinto
Joost Ruis
Mihai Dobrescu
Jerrod Frost
